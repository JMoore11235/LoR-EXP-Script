# LoR-EXP-Script
Script to run with either two of your accounts or with another person. In essence, you use this to grind your daily win/loss exp. Designed to alternate wins between players, but can be run so one person always wins and one always loses.



Steps to run:

**1. Install AutoHotKey**

  * Go to https://www.autohotkey.com/, click on "Download" and then "Download Current Version".
  * Run the executable, then you can click "Exit" when given the menu with 4 options. (You don't need to click on "Run AutoHotKey").
 
 
**2. Download "Lor Surrender Script vX_X.ahk"**

  * Self-explanatory. Put this file somewhere where you'll remember it (or don't, I don't care).


**3. Setup the script**

  * Right click on the script and click on "Edit Script". Notepad is fine for this (or something similar).
